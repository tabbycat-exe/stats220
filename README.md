# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Information and Technology Management (BSci)
- I am taking STATS 220 because I enjoy data science and would like to expand my knowledge in coding within the world of data
- I am interested in learning about data wrangling and utilising code to visualise data

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://tenor.com/view/jamma-orb-jamma-orb-plankton-cursed-gif-8828974721685493246)
